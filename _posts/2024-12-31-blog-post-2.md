title: 'Scraping FFIEC Call Report Data with Selenium'

This post is about a project I completed in 2022 using Selenium, Python, and SQL to scrape data from the FFIEC. The code for this can be found at this [GitHub link](https://github.com/garethmarkel/ffiec_scrapers).

#### Technologies and topics used: Docker, Python, AWS, SQL, Selenium


The linked Github contains schema, and Dockerized python tools, to scrape call report data from the FFIEC. This data reports all sorts of details about
registered banks, like thier assets and liabilities in various categories. I wrote this code to run on AWS batch, but it could easily be adapted to 
run on a home computer (the magic of docker). Data gets dropped in Aurora, and all scrapers are fault tolerant (e.g. if a request gets bounced back,
you won't end up with duplicates).
