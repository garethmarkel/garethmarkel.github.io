Welcome! I am a data scientist currently working on research topics in social science genetics. This work includes applications of machine learning (how can we better predict health outcomes from genotype data), econometrics & causal inference (how can we estimate unbiased effects of genetic covariates), and lots of data engineering (e.g. creating automated pipelines to analyze data on millions of variants for each of hundreds of thousands of individuals). In the past, I've worked on problems such as: applying Bayesian methods and causal inference to problems in marketing (e.g. MMM), data-driven insights for community banks, and electricity transmission futures. 

I'm currently completing a PhD in economics at George Mason, with fields in economic experiments and social science genetics. Prior to that, I obtained a master's degree and bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Alabama.
